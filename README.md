Additional threat actor profile (TAP)

KillSec (a.k.a. Kill Security) is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group, active since October 2023. Since the launch of their dedicated leak site in March 2024, KillSec has listed over 90 victims globally, with approximately 50% of victims based in Asia. The groups’ ransom demands range from thousands of dollars to 10,000 euros. KillSec primarily requests ransom in euros, which is considered uncommon amongst ransomware actors.
 
The group is observed to possess opportunistic targeting nature, though restricts targeting against CIS countries and critical infrastructure. Despite this, affiliates have been observed to compromise healthcare and government victims. The group is known to acquire access from initial access brokers or leaked credentials on the dark web to gain initial access.
 
In addition to their RaaS offerings, KillSec claims to provide penetration testing and open-source (OSINT) services to cybercriminals to assist with their reconnaissance and initial access stages of the attack.
