Below is the summary of " Japanese Financial Services Targeted by Cyberattacks" on 03 January 2025.

==Background on the Incident==
On 31 December 2024, according to public reports (Link), Mizuho Bank(瑞穗銀行) and Resona Bank(日本里索那銀行) may have been hit by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, in which the unknown threat actor overload traffic by sending enormous amounts of data.

Mizuho Bank stated that on 31 December users had difficulty accessing its internet banking system. Meanwhile, Resona Bank reported that a glitch occurred on the night of 28 December, making it difficult for retail customers to connect to its online banking service. Both bank systems were restored, but for Resona Bank, instability resurfaced shortly after 1 p.m. on 30 December.

The bank's smartphone app was also affected, and similar problems were found across all parts of the Resona Holdings group, including Saitama Resona Bank(埼玉里索那銀行), Kansai Mirai Bank(關西未來銀行), and Minato Bank(港銀行).

==OSINT Analysis and Dark Web Findings==
As of 03 January 2024, PwC had not observed any data breach or sales listed on the dark web for Mizuho Bank and Resona Bank. 

This is not the first instance of a bank being impacted by a DDoS attack. Last week, MUFG Bank was also affected by glitches apparently caused by DDoS attacks, indicating that Japanese financial services are being targeted by cyberattacks.

There is no evidence that the same threat actor group is responsible, and the motivation for targeting Japanese financial groups is uncertain.

==Conclusion==
At this time of writing, there is no Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) have been published. PwC will continue ongoing monitoring for any potential data breaches or updates, including any new information about the threat actors involved.
