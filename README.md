We recommend confirming that the service coverage is to customers only, or whether it also includes staff and/or third-party, and evaluate if accounts with administrative privileges require a password change.  We also recommend to heighten monitoring of customer login to indicate anomalies in location or timing, and review password policies and evaluate if there is a need to strengthen (e.g., mandate password rotation regularly). A further recommendation is to reach out to these account holders if the accounts are still active, and request that they change their passwords.​
