Recommendations by PwC
The user should apply the patch after the implementation of workaround.
Justification
Please note that a local-in policy that only allows FGFM connections from a specific IP will reduce the attack surface, but it wonâ€™t prevent the vulnerability from being exploited from this IP. Consequently, this is not a complete workaround.

All the mentioned FortiManager instances by users should follow the patch.

Justification
Given the active exploitation by threat actor and the public release of Proof-of-Concept (PoC), we assess other threat actors may exploit CVE-2024-47575.
